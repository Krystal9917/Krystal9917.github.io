Hi, I'm Jiujiu, an incoming PhD student at HKUST(GZ) in 24Fall. My reearch interests focus on graph neural networks and machine learning. I will be guided by [Prof. Sihong Xie](https://sihongxie.github.io/) and co-supervised by [Prof. Hui Xiong](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=cVDF1tkAAAAJ&hl=en). I will obtain my Master's Degree in Computer Technology in June 2024 from University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC). Prior to that, I received my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science and Technology from Southwestern University of Finance and Economics (SWUFE) on June 2021. 

I had a long time research intern experience in Advanced Computing and Storage Lab, 2012Labs, HUAWEI (June 2022 to December 2023), mentored by [Dr. Yuxiang Ren](https://yuxiangren.github.io/) and [Dr. Weitao Du](https://openreview.net/profile?id=~weitao_Du1). During this time, I completed several projects related to graph neural networks.
